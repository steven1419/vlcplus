## Features

We combined [MPAndroidChart](https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart) to the VLC for Android. We add a line chart that record the history details, including usage time and history videos. You can also add and check your own comment on each record individually, even to the same video played in different day.



## Build and Run

Build and run this app requires the official VLC compile method. Please visit the **official VLC for Android wiki** page [here](https://wiki.videolan.org/AndroidCompile/) for more information.
